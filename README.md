## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:

- Operational documentation
- Configuration reference
- Rebuild guide
- Knowledge base for Linux-based game server hosting

It reflects real-world system administration practices focused on stability,
security, and repeatability rather than tutorial-style walkthroughs.
